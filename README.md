Webekspressen - Jan Andersen

I am a one-man-army of Fullstack development in all things related to and revolving around web and app-development. 

What more could I say about me, well... Just about everything(!!!), but I won't bother until immortality is so trivial that neither You nor I would mind listening to me talking for an Eternity about all my talents and star qualities. In this regard I am kind of all or nothing and I am just not ready for "all" yet.
