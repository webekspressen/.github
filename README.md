Webekspressen - Jan Andersen

I am a one-man-army of fullstack development in web and app-development. 

What more could I say about, well... Just about everything, but I won't bother until immortality is so trivial that neither You nor I would mind listening to me talking for an Eternity about all my talents and star qualities. In this regard I am kind of all or nothing and I am just not ready for saying all yet.
